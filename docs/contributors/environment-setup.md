# Contributing - Environment Setup

This page assumes you're already _a little familiar_ with **Git, VS Code, and programming in general**.

You do _not_ need to be an expert, but you should know how to clone a repo, open a project in VS Code, and install basic tools. Each section below briefly explains how to set up your environment for the different parts of the FIRM ecosystem.
