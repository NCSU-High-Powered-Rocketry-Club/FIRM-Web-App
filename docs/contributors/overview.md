# Contributing to FIRM - Overview

FIRM is a **multidisciplinary project** that spans:

- Firmware and embedded software
- PCB design
- Higher-level libraries and tools

---

## Purpose of These Instructions

The primary goal of these instructions is to give **new members** a clear, structured path to follow to help them get started.

---

## Intended Audience

These docs will provide resources to help anyone contribute to FIRM, but having some or all of the following skills will be helpful:

- Basic programming knowledge
- Basic Git familiarity
- Very basic understanding of electronics/circuitry

---

## High-Level Architecture

At a very high level, the FIRM ecosystem includes:

- **Hardware** - the FIRM PCB and related circuitry (a microcontroller, sensors, other electrical components, etc.).
- **Firmware** - code running on the microcontroller: sensor drivers, data logging, communication.
- **Connected Device** - a device that connects to FIRM and receives data (e.g. a laptop, Raspberry Pi, etc.).

TODO: maybe make a diagram here?

## Getting Started as a Contributor

If you're new to FIRM, you should probably first **[skim the user docs](../users/getting-started.md)** so you know what the device looks like from an end user's perspective.

Next, if you're interested in programming, you should follow **[these steps](environment-setup.md)** to set up your development environment.

Or if you're interested in the electronics/PCB design, you should follow **[the steps](kidcad-setup.md)** to get KiCad and learn our design process/practices.

## Keeping our Docs Up-to-Date

If you notice missing, outdated, or confusing information:

- Please open an issue or a PR.
- Add diagrams, screenshots, or small clarifying paragraphs wherever they help.
